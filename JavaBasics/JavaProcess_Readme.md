File extension is .java, which is a human-readable format
Example: HelloWorld.java

The javac (compiler) converts
.java → .class, which produces Bytecode

Bytecode :
Bytecode is a platform-independent intermediate code generated by the Java compiler and executed by the JVM using Interpreter and JIT.

The same bytecode run on any OS with JVM. → WORA(Write Once Read Anywhere)

Class Loader loads the .class file into JVM memory

ByteCode Verification is done by the Bytecode Verifier

Execution is done by the Execution Engine in 2 ways

1) Interpreter  -  Executes bytecode line by line(slower)
2) JIT (Just In Time) Compiler - JVM uses both Interpreter and JIT(faster)

JVM executes the main() method and after producing the output it will terminate.

Command line arguments
These are passed to the main () method. After entering at command prompt are stored in args array.
Each argument is treated as String even though if it is a num.SO, to use numeric values, arguments must be converted using methods like Integer.ParseInt().
The index starts at 0
